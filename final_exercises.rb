# 7. What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?
# => Array is an ordered list whereas Hash is unordered, so with Array we can be certain that the objects are still at the same position, where with hash we look for an object based on a key.

# 8. Create a Hash using both Ruby syntax styles.

# 9. Suppose you have a hash h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}
#   1. Get the value of key `:b`
#   2. Add to this hash the key:value pair `{e:5}`
#   3. Remove all key:value pairs whose value is less than 3.5

# 11. Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say

# and populate the associated data from the contact_data array.
# Hint: you will probably need to iterate over ([:email, :address, :phone]),

# Note that this exercise is only concerned with dealing with 1 entry
# in the contacts hash, like this:
