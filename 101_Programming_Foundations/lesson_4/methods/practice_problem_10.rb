# Given the munsters hash below

# Modify the hash such that each member of the Munster family has
# an additional "age_group" key that has one of three values describing
# the age group the family member is in (kid, adult, or senior).
# Your solution should produce the hash below

#   "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male", "age_group" => "kid" },
#   "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female", "age_group" => "adult" } }

# Note: a kid is in the age range 0 - 17, an adult is in the range 18 - 64
# and a senior is aged 65+.
