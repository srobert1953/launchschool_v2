Take everything you've learned so far and build a mortgage calculator (or car payment calculator -- it's the same thing).

You'll need three pieces of information:

the loan amount
the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
the loan duration
From the above, you'll need to calculate the following two things:

monthly interest rate
loan duration in months
You can use the following formula:

m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j)**(-n)))

m = monthly payment
p = loan amount
j = monthly interest rate
n = loan duration in months
Finally, don't forget to run your code through Rubocop.

Hints:

Figure out what format your inputs need to be in. For example, should the interest rate be expressed as 5 or .05, if you mean 5% interest?
If you're working with Annual Percentage Rate (APR), you'll need to convert that to a monthly interest rate.
Be careful about the loan duration -- are you working with months or years? Choose variable names carefully to assist in remembering.

Example
Input:
loan_amount = 100
apr = 5%
loan_duration = 1 (years?)

Output:
monthly_interest = 5 / 12.0 / 100.0 =
loan_duration_months = 1 * 12

# Formula
monthly_payment = loan_amount * ( monthly_intetest / ( 1 - (1 + monthly_interest)**(-loan_duration_months)))

# More sense formula for later try
total_loan_amount = (1 + ( loan_duration_months * apr / 1200)) * loan_amount
monthly_payment = total_amount_loan / loan_duration_months

Pseudo:
calculate monthly payment
input
  - desired loan amount
    - amount includes cents
  - desired annual percentage rate
    - collected as percent, allowing 2 decimal, eg.: 3.45%
  - loan duration in years
    - only integer allowed
output
  - calculate monthly interest rate
  - calculate loan duration
  - calculate monthly payment

Phase 1:
load messages file in yml format
set language
Getting input
Ask user for name
Ask user for desired loan amount
  - check that no more than two decimal is entered
  - check only number is entered
Ask user for APR
  - check no more than two decimal is entered
  - check only number is entered
  - if % sign entered, deal with it
Ask user for loan duration in years
  - check only integer is entered

BEGIN
GET yml file
SET language
GET users name

GET user input for loan amount
IF input is integer or two decimal float
  SET loan amount

GET user input for APR
IF input is integer or two decimal float
  OR
  input includes % sign
  SET APR

GET user input for loan duration
IF input is integer only
  SET loan duration

END

Phase 2:
Calculations
create a float numbers from loan amount and apr
create an integer from year
calculate monthly interest rate
calculate loan duration in months
calculate monthly payment
